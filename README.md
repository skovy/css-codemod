### PostCSS

[PostCSS](https://postcss.org) is the core tool used for performing code transformations. As a result, much of it's API is re-surfaced in this toolkit and will link to it's documentation.

## Motivation

**css-codemod** is inspired by tools like [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) to streamline CSS transformations whether it be an evolving codebase, or adopting newer syntax.
